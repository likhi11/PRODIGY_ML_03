# Task-03: Cat vs Dog Image Classification using SVM

## Objective:
Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using the Kaggle dataset.

## Dataset:
[Dogs vs Cats - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

## Instructions:
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and extract the `train` folder.
2. Place the `train` folder inside a `dataset` directory in the same folder as the script.
3. Run `svm_dog_vs_cat.py` to train and evaluate the SVM model.

## Note:
- The model uses grayscale images resized to 64x64.
- It uses a linear kernel for classification.
